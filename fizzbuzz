// FizzBuzz++ (Javascript/Node.js)
// Looking for: General programming, succinctness
// Time allocation: Approximately 30 minutes
// Notes: If you are not familiar with Node.js feel free to answer using JavaScript in a browser environment and adapt the specification to this environment to the best of your ability.
// Write a script that will be executed from the command line.
// The script should echo the numbers 1 to 500 except in the following cases:
// If the number is a prime echo: 'FiZZBUZZ++'
// If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 the script should echo: 'FIZZBUZZ'
// If the number is divisible by 3 the script should echo: 'FIZZ'
// If the number is divisible by 5 the script should echo: 'BUZZ'
// Each output should be on a new line.
// The script should also log the above output to a file called fizzbuzz.log.
// Data that may already be in the fizzbuzz.log file should not be overwritten.

let numbers = Array(500)

for (i = 0; i < 500; i++) {
  numbers[i] = i + 1;
}
for (i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  console.log(numbers[i]);
  if (i % 5 == 0 ){
    return console.log('BUZZ');
  }
}
