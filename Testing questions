Question - I'd like to learn more about your views on testing software:
Why do we test our software as engineers
What best practices are there for testing software
Where you have applied those best practices

•	Testing code makes is more reliable.
•	Reduces the risk of bad code.
•	Saves time and money i.e sorting out bugs later on.
•	Provides higher standard of code.
•	Including testing makes you a more well-rounded engineer.

•	Unit testing.
•	Writing tests first before main code.
•	Using programs like Jest, Cypress, Enzyme.

•	Morse code project where the test where written first to determine only one outcome from translating.
